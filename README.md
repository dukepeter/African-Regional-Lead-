# SingularityNET Africa - Regional Leadership

## Introduction

This repository showcases my leadership contributions as the Regional Lead of the SingularityNET Africa Guild and the grunt work in building the SingularityNET Africa community. My efforts were crucial in expanding SingularityNET's presence across Africa by establishing student-led AI initiatives, organising town halls and conferences, and leading research into how AI can be ethically integrated into African markets and societies. The repository contains resources, event materials, and insights from my work with the Guild. This is still ongoing and will be liable to changes.

## Context

**The SingularityNET Ambassador Program** is a decentralized network of like-minded individuals that aims to make advanced AI technologies accessible and beneficial to all. As the **African Regional Lead**, I spearheaded initiatives introducing these technologies to universities, businesses, and individuals in Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon, Rwanda, and South Africa. My leadership has been instrumental in fostering an African-focused AI ecosystem that champions inclusivity and Indigenous solutions. I am also building the African community to give it a seat at the table in conversations and opportunities like this one.

My primary responsibilities include and are not restricted to:
- Establishing student AI clubs across multiple countries.
- Onboarding new members into the SingularityNET ecosystem.
- Organising the **Ubuntu and AI** event to explore how African philosophies can shape ethical AI development and deployment.
- Conducting market research into green economies for AI applications.
- Leading discussions on AI’s role in Africa’s socio-economic development.

## Key Contributions

1. **Establishing AI Student Clubs**:
   - Founded AI-focused clubs across 10 tertiary institutions in 4 countries: Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon, and Rwanda.
   - Engaged students and tech enthusiasts from 5 countries, including Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon, Rwanda and South Africa, in SingularityNET’s mission.

2. **Event Organization**:
   - Organized the **Ubuntu and AI** event, which explored how African philosophical principles, such as Ubuntu, could influence the ethical development and deployment of AI technologies.
   - Weekly town halls to engage with members of the SingularityNET Africa community.
   - Initiated plans for the first **African AGI/AI Conference** to be held on **November 2, 2024**, with over 3,000 attendees expected.

3. **Research and Market Penetration**:
   - Led research initiatives focused on identifying **green economies** and **Indigenous tooling** for AI in Africa.
   - Investigated potential AI applications that align with sustainable development and ethical technology use.

4. **Inclusivity and Accessibility**:
